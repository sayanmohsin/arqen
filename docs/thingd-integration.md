# thingd integration

thingd is a first-class Arqen dependency. It supplies objects, events, search, links, and durable queues.

The first stable boundary is thingd's public HTTP API. Arqen should not import private thingd-cloud internals or require a Node.js SDK.

The adapter boundary should support:

- typed object repositories;
- batch writes;
- append-only events;
- queue push, claim, ack, nack, and dead-letter operations;
- full-text and vector search when enabled;
- links for relationships.

Implemented and planned adapter paths:

```text
ThingdBackend
  +-- MemoryThingdBackend (implemented)
  +-- NativeThingdStore (implemented)
  +-- HttpThingdBackend (implemented; public-contract validation required)
  +-- CloudThingdBackend (optional, future)
```

Switching implementations must not change application domain services.

## Hardening boundary

Applications that need local durable thingd during development and hosted
thingd in production should use the same domain repository interfaces across
the storage modes. The reusable gaps to solve in Arqen are documented in
[application-hardening.md](application-hardening.md): scoped access,
conditional writes, idempotency, event cursors, HTTP contract validation, and
the optional public cloud adapter.

Arqen must not implement local/cloud synchronization itself, import private
thingd-cloud modules, or read cloud control-plane databases. The sync engine,
checkpoint semantics, conflict policy, tombstones, and transport belong to
thingd. Arqen should integrate the thingd-provided capability through a
versioned public API and provide configuration, identity, lifecycle, health,
metrics, and capability discovery around it.

## Adapter contract

See [adapter-contract.md](adapter-contract.md) for the full trait definition, data types, and implementation details.

Native durable and HTTP modes should be treated as deployment-specific paths
until recovery, timeout, retry, and compatibility tests have been run against
the target thingd version. Cloud hosting is not implemented by this package.
